## My project is missing

If your project is not listed on the **Your Projects** page when you're signed in chances are there is nothing we can do about it. Since Thimble is often used in classroom settings on public computers, is there a chance that someone might have gained access to your account and deleted it?

## My published project is not working

The most common reason for this is that your project does not have an ``index.html`` file. You can add one by right-clicking the file view and selecting **Add File** or by using the green file menu above the list of files and selecting **Add HTML file**, then renaming it (by right-clicking) to ``index.html``.

## Trouble Signing In

If you have forgotten your password, you can create a new one. To do so, go to the Sign In page and then click **Forgot your password?** link. You'll be asked for your account username or email. Use whichever one you remember, and you'll receive an email with instructions on how to reset your password.

**Not getting the email?** 
If you're not seeing the email, check your Spam folder, it often gets caught there.

**Forgot which email you used?**
If you don't remember which email is associated with your Thimble account, please contact us and we'll help you resolve it. We may ask some questions to help identify you, like the title of some of your projects, for example.
