These steps are meant to help you in cases where you are trying to open a project in the Thimble editor. It could be a brand new project you are starting, a project that you have just tried to remix, or an existing project that you worked on in the past.

First, determine what kind of error screen are you seeing, and follow the appropriate steps...

* A Green error screen with a **Try Again** button - [Try these steps](#green-loading-screen)
* A Black error screen with a **Reload Now** button - [Try these steps](#black-error-screen)

If the steps on this page aren't helping, please [contact us](#still-stuck-let-us-know).

## Green Loading Screen
Are you stuck on the green loading screen? Here are a few things you can try...

* First, click the **Try Again** button a few times and see if that helps.
* Give Thimble a little more time than usual to load, sometimes with a slow network and larger files, it might take longer to download everything. If that doesn't work...
* [Clear your browser's cache](https://github.com/mozilla/thimble.mozilla.org/wiki/Clearing-your-cache)
* [Reset your browser's IndexedDB](https://github.com/mozilla/thimble.mozilla.org/wiki/Reset-indexedDB)

If that doesn't work, please contact us.

## Black Error Screen
This error means that the editor was unable to load.

* First, are you using Private Browsing when using Thimble?
  * Turn it off and reload the page, Thimble needs to store some of your files in the browser storage, which is disabled when you're using Private Browsing.
* Click the **Reload Now** button a few times and see if that helps.

If that doesn't work, please contact us.
