There isn't an automated way to create multiple accounts for a group of useres. However...

### You don't need an active email to create an account

Users can put in a fake email and still create an account. The downside of this is that if they will not be able to recover their password if they forget it. The upside is that they can get started quickly and without needing to have access to email. For a one-off session, as long as they publish their work after, they can always create an account later and remix their published projects.

### The Gmail Trick

One option for a group leader or instructor is to use the "Gmail + trick" when setting up accounts for users ahead of time. With this trick, if you create a Gmail account like ``mygroup@gmail.com`` you can then create Thimble accounts using this one email by adding a "+something" to it. Thimble will treat those emails as unique, while Gmail will treat them as the same.

For example, you can set up Thimble accounts using an email like: ``mygroup+1@gmail.com``, ``mygroup+2@gmail.com``. Now, if one of those users forgets their password, the password recovery email will always go to to the ``mygroup@gmail.com`` email, allowing the group leader to reset it with the user.
